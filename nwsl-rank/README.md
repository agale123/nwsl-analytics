# NWSL Rank

The goal is to create a visualization of how team standings have changed over
the course of the NWSL season. This was created part of the way through the
2022 season. Here is a sample visualization:

I also made a visualization of points per match but it can be difficult to 
perceive patterns so I stopped updating it:
